# Relearn C++ in a Modern Way

Following up the previous post by learning Rust, I'm trying my new recommendation approach for relearning modern C++ from scratch.

This is more a documentary for myself instead of a general guide. I've picked on two beginner-friendly books:

1. [C++ Primer Plus](https://amzn.eu/d/2DQkEeY) by Stephen Prata
2. [C++ Crash Course](https://ccc.codes) by Josh Lospinoso

Why these two books? They feel less heavy than others. I want to quickly understand the missing from C++99/03 to modern C++11/14/17/20. If my memory is good enough, the latest version I used professionally was C++03 maybe some C++11 on Visual Studio 2012. So, I think these books are good enough for me to refresh my knowledge and help to build foundation on new C++.

Afterwards, I'm planning to dive deeper:

1. [A Tour of C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/tour3.html) by Bjarne Stroustrup
2. [The C++ Programming Language](https://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html) by Bjarne Stroustrup
3. [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html) by Bjarne Stroustrup
4. [Effective Modern C++](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-modern-c/9781491908419/) by Scott Meyers
5. [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action-second-edition) by Anthony Williams
6. [Learn C++ by Example](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-c-plus-plus-by-example) by Frances Buontempo

Meanwhile, I'm doing exercises on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp).

Let's see how far I can go. It's pure for fun.
