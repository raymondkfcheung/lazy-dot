# Failed Candidate

Before preparing for interviews, it helps to understand why the process feels broken - and why it's genuinely difficult. [Kristen Shaker's explanation captures this reality well](https://youtu.be/WKVH0Lexw_U); it's worth watching that first.

The short version: you shouldn't *need* to study. As [Joe Smith](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/hrtbeat/engineering-and-interviewing-at-hrt/) at HRT once said, “Our ideal is that a strong programmer from a competitive environment should be able to ace our technical interview without doing any preparation."

But reality rarely works that way.

## Coding

If you do need to study, the most effective approach is still structured practice. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) is the modern equivalent of what [*Cracking the Coding Interview*](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) used to be. These days, channels like [**Cracking FAANG**](https://www.youtube.com/@crackfaang) and [**NeetCode**](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode) offer the clearest breakdowns of patterns and approaches.

Some interviews take a pair-programming style instead, where you build a component step by step - such as [implementing a cache](https://blog.janestreet.com/what-a-jane-street-dev-interview-is-like/). These questions examine your grasp of data structures and algorithms at a conceptual level rather than your ability to recall a particular pattern.

For deep understanding, [Robert Sedgewick](https://sedgewick.io)'s [*Algorithms*](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu) course remains one of the best foundations.

## Technical Discussion

This part assesses your fundamentals: language internals, concurrency, atomics, and the ability to explore system-level questions. If you understand the basics well, it shouldn't be too daunting.

The difficulty is that the discussion flows based on your answers. You might start with "What is async?" and suddenly find yourself comparing Rust's `Future` to Java's `Future`, talking about executors, or explaining how an event loop works. The follow-ups are unpredictable.

If you know the material, you'll be fine. If you don't, it's better to say so than to bluff. This type of knowledge builds up through day-to-day work rather than memorising definitions. Rote answers don't travel far.

## System Design

Most system design rounds revolve around common systems - YouTube, WhatsApp, or domain-specific components such as [building an exchange](https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/building-an-exchange/). Interviewers rarely wander beyond your experience or the technologies listed on your CV, since that would waste time.

If you prepare only one thing, skim [**Designing Data-Intensive Applications**](https://dataintensive.net) by Martin Kleppmann. It's the "gold book" of system design.

Platforms like [**HelloInterview**](https://www.hellointerview.com) offer well-structured frameworks, reading lists, and video walkthroughs that can help you articulate your thinking clearly.

## Behavioural Questions

These assess how you interact with people. There is no "right" personality; it's mostly about fit. If you communicate clearly, you're usually fine.

The only real advice here: [be honest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJKYqLP6MRE). Pretending to match a culture you don't believe in will only hurt you later, even if you get the job. Authenticity is ultimately easier and more sustainable.

## Why Candidates Fail

There are countless reasons you may not receive an offer. Some are fair; some aren't; many are entirely outside your control.

* **Broken interview** – The process was [flawed or incoherent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gruebgQ1sPI). Your actual ability wasn't measured.
* **Stronger candidate** – You did well, but someone else did better. You cannot influence this.
* **Technical gap** – You lacked certain knowledge or signals. Sometimes this just means you need clearer explanations or a better narrative.
* **Poor fit** – Your communication or working style didn't align with the team. Again, not something you can force.

## The Two Per Cent

There are many ways to fail - and you will fail often. Everyone does. The only path forward is to prepare, re-apply, and succeed once. Figure out *why* you fell short. Turn each failure into a specific lesson. There's no magic; only repetition, reflection, and persistence.
