# My Journey as a Blockchain Developer

It's hard to spot the right moment, and easy to miss it. Looking back, I missed the early chance to join the wave in 2017 - but that's history now.

My next journey began in 2021, when I first heard about [Polkadot](https://polkadot.com). I started [learning Rust](learn-rust.md) and applied for the first-ever [Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA)](https://polkadot.com/blockchain-academy). I even reached the interview stage, but I couldn't be away from my family for that long, so the application didn't progress.

After that, I kept studying blockchain technologies - [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), [Solana](https://solana.com), and of course Polkadot - focusing on [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org) and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). I watched nearly all the [PBA videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@polkadotblockchainacademy) (the ones uploaded in 2024). Then I took a chance and eventually landed a position at [Parity](https://www.parity.io). I joined in 2025, and now I'm a blockchain developer.

Why am I writing this? When I was at [PBA7 in Bali](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL38irG6xTQaJIR-WiVjqdK7ujJSWx5vfT), many students asked me how to get a job in the industry. To be honest, I don't fully know how I ended up at a top-tier firm despite not having extensive Web3 experience. My best guess is that my technical skills were strong, and I have a genuine curiosity for learning new things. Web3 evolves quickly. Without adaptability, even the best developer at one moment can be left behind the next. The ability to learn and adjust matters more than what you already know. So my advice is: keep learning and keep connecting the dots.

Technically, you still need solid skills such as problem-solving and proficiency in at least one widely-used language - Rust, [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))/[C++](https://isocpp.org), [Java](https://www.java.com), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [Python](https://www.python.org), [Swift](https://www.swift.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and so on. More niche languages like [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) are fine too, as long as your interviewers can understand your code. Choose your language wisely.

Then choose your ecosystem: Polkadot, Ethereum, Solana, or something else? I can't speak for the others, as my experience is mainly with Polkadot. Most protocols are open source, so browse their repositories, review PRs, and contribute where you can. Find the ecosystem that suits you best and immerse yourself in it. For Polkadot, you can join PBA before committing fully. It's a personal choice. I'm biased, so I won't compare ecosystems here.

Preparation matters: understand blockchain fundamentals, practise some [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)-style questions, read interview blogs like [HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com), and try to get mock interviews if possible. When you're ready, apply.

Simple? Yes - but also [hard](https://youtu.be/WKVH0Lexw_U)!
