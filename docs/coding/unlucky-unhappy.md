# How to Make Yourself Unlucky and Unhappy

Working as a software engineer is challenging. [Interview processes](prep-interviews.md) have become increasingly demanding. In the past it was common to have two rounds before receiving an offer. Now the process can stretch to eight or more, and some people even face ten. At the same time, technology continues to evolve. New languages and frameworks appear constantly. Others fade away. A career in software development isn't straightforward.

Here are some reliable ways to make yourself even more unlucky and unhappy.

## Preparing Badly

People say that practice makes perfect, but in reality only the right practice leads to good results. Repeating the wrong approach can make things worse than not preparing at all. Sometimes I expect a technical discussion and instead face live coding, or the reverse. If I'm in good condition I can adapt, but that's not always the case. It's true that you can check formats with recruiters, yet unexpected situations still arise.

## Anchoring Bias

I know many successful engineers. When I compare myself with them, I sometimes feel as if I'm at the bottom. It's an unfair comparison because we're on different paths. They may have caught certain opportunities at the right moment, and I may not have. Our careers diverged from there. My value isn't defined by the people around me.

## Confirmation Bias

This has become more pronounced since the arrival of LLMs. They often agree with whatever you say, which reinforces mistaken ideas and pushes you further down the wrong track. When you eventually spot a flaw, the response is usually something like "good catch" or "you're correct," even if the reasoning was questionable in the first place. Checking facts helps, but opinions are harder to validate, and blind spots are real. Confirmation bias makes them even harder to detect.

## Regret

When these habits combine, they lead to poor decisions that feel irreversible. Then comes regret for what you should have done, the opportunities you missed, or the choices you made. It's easy to fall into a rabbit hole and find yourself in a darker place. It's fine to feel regret, but it helps to give it boundaries. Before making any serious decision, take a break, cool down, do something unrelated, and then revisit the issue with fresh eyes. Not every deployment can be rolled back, but you can patch what you can and move on.

## Self Doubt

Reflection is valuable, but being too harsh on yourself is unhealthy. It erodes confidence, clouds judgement and makes you forget your strengths. Treat yourself with more kindness. Failure is a normal part of life. You may not always be on the right path, but you can find a way back. It may be painful at times, yet trusting yourself is the first step out.

## Being Unprepared for the Worst Case

In software we write many tests to avoid edge cases. Unit tests, integration tests, behavioural tests and various stress tests all aim to reduce surprises. Real life doesn't offer the same guarantees. Edge cases can't always be predicted, and even when you expect them, preparation may still fall short. Planning is easy. Execution is harder, especially when your energy is limited.

## Be Lucky, Be Happy

All of these have been my ways of undermining myself and making life more difficult than it needed to be. There are probably more, but these are the most significant. They're not universal truths, only personal reflections. I share them to help myself move on. I can look back, but I can't change the past. I still have the present. 

The future is you. « C'est vous l'avenir ».
