# Relearning C++, Part 2

Continuing from [Part 1](relearn-cpp.md), this update sits somewhere between a progress log and a small reflection on where I'm with modern C++. Since restarting this journey, I've worked through Stephen Prata's [*C++ Primer Plus*](https://amzn.eu/d/2DQkEeY) and completed 56 out of 100 exercises on [Exercism's C++ track](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp). Along the way I've dipped into far too many [CppCon talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CppCon) - a dangerous rabbit hole, but a very enjoyable one.

*C++ Primer Plus* is from 2012 and only reaches C++11. I know modern C++ has moved far beyond that. After watching Stroustrup's [*Delivering Safe C++*](https://youtu.be/I8UvQKvOSSw), it's clear that if your goal is serious professional work, you should aim directly at C++23/26. His advice is the right one for that path.

But that isn't the path I'm on.

Relearning C++ for me isn't about chasing the next job or signalling anything. It's a way to reconnect with programming itself - to bridge the gap between the C++98/03 era I once knew and the modern language it has become. It's a history lesson disguised as a study plan. If you want a practical guide, listen to Stroustrup. If you want a quiet walk through the past to understand how the present emerged, this is mine.

Next, I'll move on to Josh Lospinoso's [*C++ Crash Course*](https://ccc.codes), which reaches C++17. It continues the same idea: understand the evolution before stepping fully into the present. I'll keep going through Exercism, and keep watching the *Back to Basics* talks from CppCon - they are some of the clearest introductions to how modern C++ actually thinks.

Slow progress, but enjoyable.

Looking back across my career, I can see how often I pushed myself in ways that were quietly self-destructive. I worked hard, but the intention behind that effort wasn't healthy. I kept trying to prove something - to whom, I still don't know. The joy of writing code faded and was replaced by ritual: another LeetCode question, another system design chapter, another video on behavioural patterns, another mock interview. A loop with no horizon, no meaning, just momentum.

Eventually the effort detached from any purpose. I lost the track not because I lacked skill, but because I forgot *why* I enjoyed this craft in the first place. Everything became preparation for a future that never arrived, and nothing became living in the present. So I picked something intentionally unconnected to my current work and unlikely to matter for any future role. C++ is not a career move. It's the opposite. It's a way to step outside the noise and rebuild a quieter relationship with programming - away from signals, interviews, expectations, and the constant pressure to optimise every choice for employability.

Relearning C++ has become a small act of self-healing. A reminder that I once learnt things simply because I liked them. No agenda. No performance metrics. No interview waiting at the other end.

Just curiosity. Just the craft. Just me.
