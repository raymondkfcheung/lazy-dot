# Relearning C++ the Modern Way

After writing about [how I learnt Rust](learn-rust.md), I decided to apply the same learning approach to another long-standing gap of mine: modern [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). This isn't intended as a universal guide - it's more of a personal log for how I'm refreshing my C++ knowledge after years of working in Java, Python, and most recently Rust.

## Why Revisit C++ Now?

My professional C++ experience topped out around C++03, with the occasional feature from early C++11 when I used Visual Studio 2012. Modern C++ has changed dramatically since then. As I've become more comfortable with Rust, I keep bumping into low-level ideas that map back to modern C++ idioms. It feels like the right moment to catch up - properly this time.

## Starting with Beginner-Friendly Books

I picked two accessible books that don't overwhelm you with every corner of the language:

1. [C++ Primer Plus](https://amzn.eu/d/2DQkEeY) - Stephen Prata
2. [C++ Crash Course](https://ccc.codes) - Josh Lospinoso

These feel lighter than the classic heavyweight references. My goal here isn't mastery yet - just to bridge the gap from the C++98/03 era I knew, into the modern world of C++. Together, these books form a practical refresher and help me rebuild a foundation that aligns with contemporary idioms.

## Going Deeper Afterwards

Once I finish the first stage, I plan to move into more serious books - especially those that define modern C++ thinking:

1. [A Tour of C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/tour3.html) - Bjarne Stroustrup
2. [The C++ Programming Language](https://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html) - Bjarne Stroustrup
3. [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html) - Bjarne Stroustrup
4. [Effective Modern C++](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-modern-c/9781491908419/) - Scott Meyers
5. [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action-second-edition) - Anthony Williams
6. [Learn C++ by Example](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-c-plus-plus-by-example) - Frances Buontempo

These should give me a clearer sense of how modern C++ is actually meant to be written - especially the concurrency and template patterns that simply didn't exist back in the C++03 days.

## Practice Along the Way

For structured exercises, I'm also working through [Exercism's C++ track](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp). It's a good balance: small, contained problems that reinforce syntax, memory management, and the newer standard-library features.

## Final Thoughts

This is entirely for fun and curiosity. Modern C++ is practically a different language from the classic version I used to write.

Let's see how far I get this time.
