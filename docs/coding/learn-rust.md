# How I Learnt Rust

## Starting the Journey

My first attempt at Rust began in 2021, working through [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The pace was irregular, and my progress stalled more than once. In 2024, I finally made a more determined effort and completed a few small side projects. By 2025, I found myself working as a Rust engineer at Web3. The [route](blockchain-journey.md) there wasn't something I had planned.

Before Rust, my day-to-day work was mostly in Java/Kotlin and Python. Moving to Rust was tough at first, even [frustrating](https://github.com/rkfcheung/coding/wiki/Comparing-Rust-and-Java). But gradually the concepts clicked, and today I'm comfortable enough that it sometimes feels like writing Python or Kotlin again.

Looking back, I realise I took the hard path to learn Rust. If I were starting fresh, I would do it differently.

## The Learning Approach I'd Recommend

1. **Begin with a Gentle Book.** Start with [*Learn Rust in a Month of Lunches*](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-rust-in-a-month-of-lunches) by David MacLeod. It's structured, friendly, and introduces core ideas without overwhelming you.
2. **Build Foundations Through Guided Exercises.** Use [Exercism's Rust track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) or the [JetBrains Academy Rust course](https://academy.jetbrains.com/course/16631-learn-rust). Both provide hands-on practice with feedback, which is especially helpful in the early stages.
3. **Rewrite Existing Solutions in Rust.** Port your existing LeetCode solutions into [Rust](https://github.com/rkfcheung/coding/wiki/Rust-Questions). This forces you to internalise ownership, borrowing, and error handling while working on problems you already understand.
4. **Read Other People's Code.** Review open-source Rust projects. Seeing how experienced developers structure their work accelerates your intuition.
5. **Join the Community.** Participate in Rust meetups and events. Discussions, talks, and casual conversations often make the harder concepts feel more natural.
6. **Contribute When Ready.** Once you're comfortable, try contributing to open source. Even small fixes help you learn idiomatic patterns and tools.

### Why This Strategy Works

* Books help you grasp the syntax quickly.
* Exercises build understanding of concepts like ownership, lifetimes, and error handling.
* LeetCode forces you to practise these ideas repeatedly until they become natural.
* Community involvement gives you exposure to different coding styles and pushes you beyond tutorial-level knowledge.

The [Rust & C++ Cardiff Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/@rustandcppcardiffmeetup4173) has been especially helpful — their book club is excellent. [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo)'s videos have also been a big part of my learning; he's one of the clearest explainers of Rust internals.

## How I Feel About Rust After a Year

After a solid year of serious use, my feelings are mixed — in a good way.

Once I overcame the initial hurdle, Rust started to feel as approachable as other languages I've used. But as I moved deeper into the ecosystem, I found myself reading more C++ material, especially when understanding unsafe code or low-level patterns. In a way, it reminded me of my early days as a classic C/C++ developer — except modern C++ has evolved so dramatically that it feels like a different language entirely.

The mental shift from C/C++ to Java was easy; the shift from Java to Rust was not. Ironically, both Java and Rust exist partly to address C++'s complexity, yet Rust does it through explicitness and strictness. Sometimes the explicitness feels heavy, but it's rooted in a philosophy of memory safety and clarity of intent.

## Conclusion

In short, yes — I still enjoy Rust. It's demanding at the beginning, but once that barrier is crossed, it becomes a powerful and rewarding language. And even when it forces me to think harder, the payoff is worth it.
